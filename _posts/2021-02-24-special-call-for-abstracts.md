As more speakers are confirmed, we have [expanded](/blog/2021/02/24/more-programme-updates) our [programmes](/programmes) to accommodate more speakers. This allows us to invite a small number of more speakers to our parallel sessions for more in-depth discussions, and bring in more perspectives.

Our parallel sessions include:

- [Integrated River Basin Management](/programmes/parallel-river-basin)
- [Climate Change and Risks](/programmes/parallel-climate)
- [Aquatic Ecology and Water Engineering](/programmes/parallel-ecology-and-engineering)
- [Water Resources Protection and Development](/programmes/parallel-water-resources)

If you are interested in presenting at the above sessions, please use the form below to submit your abstracts now before it closes on **19 March**. All abstracts should be submitted in English and will still have to go through our reviewing process. Authors will be notified of our decisions before end of March.

Please note that by proceeding, you agree to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and have read our [Guidelines for abstract submission](/take-part/#abstract).
