We are very honoured to introduce a new partner for convening the Forum -- the [International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR)](https://www.iahr.org/).

IAHR is an independent organisation made up of engineers and water specialists from the field of hydro-environment, in particular with reference to hydraulics and its practical application. Founded in 1935, IAHR now has membership from 179 countries.

Our forum aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field of water security and sustainability, which is in alignment with the mission of IAHR. We hope the close collaboration under the partnership could bring more interdisciplinarity to our discussions around water security and sustainability.
