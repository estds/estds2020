As more and more people register to take part in the Forum in person, we are afraid that the original venue (International Conference Center & Hotel of Hohai University, 1st Xikang Road, Nanjing) could not have enough space for hosting such a big audience. Therefore, after careful selection and negotiation, we have decided to move the Forum to [Fairmont Nanjing](https://www.fairmont.com/nanjing/).

Fairmont Nanjing is located on the Hexi New City in the Jianye District of Nanjing. It is one of the ten landmark buildings of Nanjing. The hotel is approximately 45 minutes drive away from Nanjing Lukou International Airport, or 25 minutes drive from Nanjing South Railway Station. Next to it is Nanjing Expo Center and Olympic Stadium.

We are talking with the hotel for special portals for room booking, and are epected to open the portal before 11 April. More information is posted on the [Logistics](/logistics) page.
