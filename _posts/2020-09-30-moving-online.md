Although we have [postponed our Forum to April next year](/blog/2020/06/30/forum-postponed-further), given the uncertainties under the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to move many of our programmes online as well, so that you could join the discussions without travelling.

We'll be updating many details regarding this change within the forthcoming month, and please stay tuned.

You are advised to sign up for our newsletter below to receive our latest information by email. Please stay safe and we look forward to seeing you online.
