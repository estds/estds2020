Our abstract submission system is open and will be closed on 15 July, 2020.

As we hope we could let everyone know our decisions **before 30 August** and processing a large amount of abstracts within a short time will be very demanding, we do appreciate if you could submit your abstract at your earliest convenience  instead of saving it to the last moment.

Thank you for paying attention to our Forum.
