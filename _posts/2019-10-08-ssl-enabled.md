We value your security.

From now on, our entire site has enforced [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) encryption. SSL encryption provides an extra layer of protection while you use our website.

Below is a flow chart (Dadian, 2019) explaining how SSL works to protect you.
