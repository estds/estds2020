## Hosting

This website, apart from a certain number of dynamic forms, is hosted on GitHub.com (see [the repository](https://github.com/estds/estds2020)). To set up the website, we found enormous help from [the tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone, to whom we would like to extend our gratitude.
