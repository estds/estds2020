    <p>As one of the two most important themes of the Forum is sustainability, we cannot talk emptily without taking actions from ourselves. We therefore woud like to invite you and everyone else at the Forum to join our initiative of &quot;<strong>Little Bits to Go Greener</strong>&quot;. We took the liberty to encourage you to start from these little bits to help lower our footprints in carbon and water.</p>

    <h2 id="bring-your-own-cup" class="display-4">Bring your own cup</h2>
    <p>People around the world purchase 1 <strong><em>million</em></strong> plastic bottles of water in every single minute, and the consumption is expected to increase by 20% by 2021 (Laville and Taylor, 2017). These plastic bottles, while consuming huge and unnecessary amount energy and resources in making and recycling them, are also threats to environment and human health. A study shows that over 90% of bottled water is contaminated by microplastics (Mason, Welch and Neratko, 2018), raising global concerns about adverse implications for human health (Karbalaei et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2019).</p>
    <p>Therefore we kindly ask you to bring your own cup or use the cups we provide at the Forum instead of consuming bottled water or using disposable cups. We'll be providing you with jarred water for drinking while limiting the use of bottled water during the Forum.</p>

    <p>On a global scale, transport accounts for more than one fifth of total energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Moreover, emission from the sector is projected to double by 2050 if no action is to be taken. Among all means of transport, road transport for passengers is responsible for a major share of emission, followed by civil aviation. However, the latter has demonstrated a rapid trend of growth (Creutzig et al., 2015). A study shows that the active use of public ground transportation could reduce almost one fourth of the emission in a business-as-usual scenario by 2040 (Peng et al., 2015). Domestic flights make up to 91% of all flights departing from China, and they contribute to almost 70% of China's emission from commercial aviation (Graver, Zhang and Rutherford, 2019).</p>
    <p>China takes proud of its highly developed railway network in which Nanjing is one of the biggest hubs. So why don't we take advantage of that? High-speed rail is believed to be very promising in decarbonisation of transport (IEA, 2017). Instead of taking taxies, we also encourage everyone of you to take our shuttle buses.

    <p class="lead text-serif">You can go paperless</p>
    <h2 id="recycle-after-use" class="display-4">Recycle after use</h2>
    <p>In China, the recycling inudstry is still far from maturity. In 2017, ten dominant types of recycled wastes reached 282 million tons, making a 11% increase than the previous year. The economic value of these wastes reached 755 billion Chinese <em>Yuan</em> (c. 108 billion US Dollars). Among the ten types, the most common ones include paper, plastics and metal. For these three types, despite of great progress, the ratios between recycled and annual production were 47.5%, 22.5% and 19.4% (MOC, 2018), which means there is still a great potential in recycling and re-using them. It would be a true waste to allow such valuable resources to go into single use without considering its environmental implications and consequences.</p>
    <p>Although Nanjing has not been implimenting waste recycling rules at individual or household level, it does not take much pain to recycle these three types of wastes, right? During the forum, we would encourage everyone to recycle paper, plastics and metal after use. Please put these items after use into separate containers we provide at the venue. We would also encourage you to go even paperless. For example, you can obtain real-time information about the forum on your mobile device instead of getting a hard copy of our brochure.

    <p class="lead text-serif">Use your appliances wisely</p>
    <h2 id="use-less-power" class="display-4">Use less power</h2>
    <p>Energy consumption in residential spaces takes about 16-50% of total energy use around the globe (Saidur, Masjuki and Jamaluddin, 2007), and there is a growing trend in the demand for this use (Allouhi et al., 2015). For example, with the on-going of global warming, energey consumption for air conditioning, in particular for cooling, is projected to be increasing significantly (Zhou et al., 2016), while the reduced heating demand in cold days has barely any offseting effect (Davis and Gertler, 2015). Behaviourial changes in residential spaces have significant impact on the consumption of energy (Allouhi et al., 2015). Study shows that energy saving behaviours in the U.S. could reduce emissions by 7.4% while having almost zero impact on the household well-being (Dietz et al., 2009). Another China-based study finds that, by improving the way occupants use their domestic appliances, they could save up to 14% in energy consumption (Ouyang and Hokao, 2009).</p>
    <p>Therefore, it would be greatly appreciated if you could use electrical appliances wisely. You can help save energy by, for example, setting your air conditioner to a higher temperature (for example, 26°C), turning off lights when you leave your room, using stairs instead of lifts if you can, and unpluging your devices from the sockets after use (Ouyang and Hokao, 2009).</p>

Share to other people when you leave us, and let's be each other's companion on our way to be more sustainable. The road ahead might be very long, but we will not be alone.</p>
