    <p>Water lies at the heart of life and well-being, yet it is a finite resource which is quickly outpaced by the global demand in rapid growth. The UN SDG 6 aims at &quot;<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/">availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all</a>&quot;, prioritising the importance of water security and sustainability in the societal and environmental welfare. However, such welfare is challenged by the current water availability. On a global scale, <a href="https://www.unwater.org/publication_categories/sdg-6-synthesis-report-2018-on-water-and-sanitation/">more than two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress</a>. In China, <a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/01/chinas-water-stress-rise">30% of its land area is suffering from high or extremely high water stress</a>. About <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/environment-institute/blog/examining-water-issues-china/">two thirds of Chinese cities are having problems sustaining sufficient water supply</a>. Therefore properly managed water has a major stake in the future. The management of water is highly dependant on our technical and institutional capacities, which are still far from enough up until now. Furthermore, latest trends such as global warming and political unrest are putting such capacities at risk. The world is undergoing rapid change, and we need to change our ways of thinking, living and managing to adapt and become more resilient.</p>
    <p>In 2015 and 2017, two Forums on water security and sustainability have been held in Nanjing, attracting attention of researchers both in China and around the world. Hence, <a href="http://www.yicode.ac">YICODE</a>, <a href="http://www.hhu.edu.cn">HHU</a> and <a href="http://www.nhri.cn">NHRI</a> are proudly announcing the 3rd Forum of the series in 2020 to continue our discussion on water security and sustainability. We sincerely hope this could provide an open, frank, productive and multi-disciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners in the field. Researchers around the globe are welcome to take part in the two-day discussion from cross-cutting perspectives.</p>
    <p>The Water Security and Sustainability Forum is one of the International Top-level Forums on Engineering Science and Technology Development Strategy (ESTDS) sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Engineering.</p>
    <h3 id="estds-forums">ESTDS Forums</h3>
    <p>The ESTDS Forums of the <a href="https://www.cae.cn">Chinese Academy of Engineering</a> could date back to 2011 when the Academy started to vision the future development of engineering science in the upcoming 20 years and even further through strategic discussions and studies. ESTDS Forums are best-known for their inter-disciplinary and international way of thinking. They try to break disciplinary boundaries for synergy in innovation and bridge the physical distances between world's leading experts for international cooperation. ESTDS Forums focus on themes that are macro-scale, strategically significant, and forward-looking.</p>
