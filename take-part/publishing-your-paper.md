For presentation at the Forum, we will collect abstracts *ONLY* before its start. After the Forum, authors of a selection of papers will be invited to publish their research in four of our partner journals. These invitations are based on your presentation at the Forum as well as quality of your research.

Therefore, full text of your paper is NOT mandatory before the Forum. Of course, if you are happy to do so, you are most welcome to submit it along with your abstract. Our reviewers might be able to know more about your research in this case, but decisions of invitation will not be based on the submitted full text as you are free to edit it as you like.
